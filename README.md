# Snake Game
My cource-project for Lviv IT School

1. Just run main.py


If you want to change size of <b>game window</b> or size of <b>cell</b> (in pixels)
you need to edit in file <b>drow_functions.py</b> this variables:
- window_width = 400
- window_height = 600
- cell_size = 20

NOTE! <b>window_width</b> and <b>window_height</b> MUST be multiples of a <b>cell_size</b> 

like 40%4 == 0 and 20%4 == 0
